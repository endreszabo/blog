In Hungary we use big-endian for pretty much everything (very much like Japan), eg. representing dates, family and given names and addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

Especially if you run your own SMTP MTAs. Without proper reverse-forward DNS record mapping, some nice anomalies may appear for you. You may have faced the fact some other MTAs shut down your incoming connection for no particular reason. OpenSSH daemon also has the option to check if your forward and reverse DNS entries match. Also, being on IRC with only an IP address is so 90&amp;rsquo;s ;)&lt;/p&gt;
