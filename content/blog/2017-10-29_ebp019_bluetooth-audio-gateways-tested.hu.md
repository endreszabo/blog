Title: "Bluetooth Audio Gateways tested"

I was long looking for a decent, yet cheap bluetooth audio gateway for my Mix Minus setup with my audio console that I could make interview phone calls with.

Simply, I need a device that meets the following minimum requirements:
- Powered with a wall plug transformer and not with a battery
- Is always on without a power switch
- Has spearate audio output *and* input connectors
- Supports the HFP bluetooth profile

Of course for everything else under the stars, there's a solution for this as well on the professional audio market.

For the following comparison I will refer to A2DP and HFP support based on the Media and Phone audio support respectively reported by the phone bluetooth menu.

CSR64215 Bluetooth receive module support protocol:
