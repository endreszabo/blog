Title: "PythonicHue: the most pythonic way to manage hue bridges"

Hue is a smart lighting line made by Philips. It consist of smart bulbs, remotes, sensors and their controlling	hub called the Hue bridge. The whole Hue ecosystem is very well supported both officially and by 3rd parties. Lots of great apps and other management tools exist. Yet, this summer, after a long ongoing research I found no one app that can manage the Hue bridge ruleset fairly well. Even the pay version apps lack the full complete support for rule attributes. Also, there are quite a few language dependt frameworks that can help with dealing different types of Hue bridge objects. After all I decided to make a Hue management framework that converts your exising Hue settings to valid python code that can be changed and ran again to actuate the changes in the hub.

```tex

\subtitle{foo}

\textbf {d sd a} sds sd \texttt ttlk sd

```

This eventually led PythonicHue, my approach of Hue bridge management, with the aim to be the most complete, yet very versatile framework. The ultimate goal is to create a Single Source of Truth, so it would also become an excellent backup solution that the Hue ecosystem is in short of.<!--more-->
