Hey, I've made a PKGBUILD for our blog engine Blogofile to be used in Arch Linux. The stable version is 0.7.1 as of now, and I will update the package if upstream comes out with a newer version. It has only one dependency (python-textile) that is not in the official Arch repo but can be found in AUR as well.
