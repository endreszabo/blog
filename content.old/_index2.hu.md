## What is this?

Welcome. You have arrived. This is my blog, that actually most of the time stands for a techblog.

Here you can find my actual ramblings about various fields of IT, most of the time in the area of Linux, networking and IoT.

This blog was always a static site. I started with the static site generator called Blogofile. Sadly, it got abandoned. After that I moved to MWeb which uses Octopress which is kind of a fork of Jekyll. But it was for macOS only. Finally I settled with Hugo, 'The worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites'.

## Disclaimer

Now for all the usual mumbo-jumbo. Posts are my own. Opinions expressed are solely my own and do not express the views or opinions of my employer. No copyright or moral infringement intended---if you want me to take anything down, just let me know. No responsibility can be accepted for any action you take or refrain from taking as a result of viewing my posts and/or other sites linked to therefrom, including but not limited to blindly copy-pasting code or other elements to your root shell found here and there.

### Usage of JavaScript

I know. JavaScript can do evil, therefore it is considered evil. The site is entirely functional without JavaScript, however I use JavaScript ~~for Google Analytics~~ to wrap the comments section provided by Disqus which is also based on JavaScript. Syntax highlighting and Asciinema session playbacks also use JavaScript, served from the website itself, so uMatrix and his friends won't shout loud.
